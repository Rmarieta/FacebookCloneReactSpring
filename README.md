# Facebook Clone using ReactJS, Spring Boot, NextAuth and MySQL

Full-stack responsive implementation of a Facebook app, with possibility to authenticate with the real Facebook credentials using NextAuth. 
The frontend UI is implemented using ReactJS and is connected to the backend implemented using Spring Boot and Spring data JPA. Posts can be added using the top section and by pressing 'Enter'. Images can be attached to posts.
Posts are then added to the feed and they persist in the database in case the page is reloaded. The posts are stored to a database using MySQL.

The design is responsive and goes for mobile mode once under a certain screen width. It then switches to a vertical design (on the right in the figure above).
